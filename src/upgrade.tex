\section{Upgrading approach}
  There are various update mechanisms available in Bitcoin (especially after
  Taproot~\cite{TODO:taproot}). We now discuss some available options. All
  options below can be extended to include the hash of
  $\mathit{tx}_{\mathrm{CRS}}$.
  \subsection{New SegWit version}
    Transactions with SegWit version 3 (or whichever is the lowest unused
    version number) are all accepted by current nodes. We could demand that
    transactions with SNARKs carry this a version number at least equal to this.
    We are largely free to define the syntax and semantics of such transactions
    as we please, so we can copy the Zcash semantics.
  \subsection{New opcode}
    Taproot defines a mechanism for specifying semantics for new opcodes. We can
    define \texttt{OP\_SNARK} that reads the next data field as a SNARK. This
    way the SNARK semantics can be combined with existing Bitcoin script.
  \subsection{New Taproot address type}
    Taproot allows for the definition of alternative semantics in the location
    currently occupied by public keys. We could replace this space with a SNARK
    and use the ``annex'' field for additional SNARK bits if needed.
