\section{Open Questions}
  \begin{itemize}
    \item Other zk-SNARK systems to consider?
    \item Possible without forcing all miners to update?
    \item Missed pitfalls?
    \item Alternative upgrade paths?
    \item Obvious optimizations/alternative approaches?
    \item Wrong Zcash approaches we would like to avoid?
    \item How to store the (rather big) SRS on-chain? If impossible, store it
    elsewhere, trustlessly.
  \end{itemize}
